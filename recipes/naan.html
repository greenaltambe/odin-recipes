            <h2 class="sub-heading">Description</h2>
            <p class="description">This is an authentic Indian naan recipe that's broiled instead of pan-fried. I have
                made
                it
                many times. It goes
                well with Indian curry dishes that have a lot of gravy, such as butter chicken.

                <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)

                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast

                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar

                </li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour

                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt

                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt

                </li>
                <li>¼ cup ghee

                </li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kalonji (onion seed)

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="steps-container basic-container">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li>Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place
                    for
                    10
                    minutes.

                </li>
                <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee.
                    Mix
                    into
                    a soft dough, then knead on a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
                    Place
                    dough into a large greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until
                    doubled
                    in
                    volume.

                </li>
                <li>Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece out
                    into
                    8-inch rounds.

                </li>
                <li>Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds with remaining ghee and
                    sprinkle
                    with
                    kalonji. Cook one at a time under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per
                    side.
